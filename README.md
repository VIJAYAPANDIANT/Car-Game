## 🛠️ Technical Details

This project utilizes modern web technologies to bring a console-like experience to the browser:

- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for rendering the game graphics efficiently.
- **WebAssembly (Wasm)**: The game logic is compiled to WebAssembly for near-native performance.
- **Emscripten**: Used to port the C/C++ game engine to the web.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the DOM interactions, event listeners, and bridges the gap between the browser and the WASM module.
